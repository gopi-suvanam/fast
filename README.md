# 🚀 FAST Server Implementation
### Functional, Augmented State Transfer (FAST)

A **FAST (Functional, Augmented State Transfer)** Server is a next-generation web server architecture inspired by REST and GraphQL — designed for **functional APIs**, **stateful interactions**, and **augmented data transfer**.  
This implementation demonstrates how FAST principles can be applied to build scalable, reactive, and maintainable backend systems.

## 🧠 Overview

FAST (Functional, Augmented State Transfer) extends traditional REST by adding **functional endpoints** and **state augmentation**:

- **Functional Endpoints:**  
  Instead of CRUD-only resources, endpoints expose *functional units* — allowing clients to trigger complex workflows directly.
  
- **Augmented State:**  
  Responses carry contextual metadata (state deltas, computed insights, and triggers) to make clients more intelligent without additional calls.
  
- **Declarative Interactions:**  
  Clients declare desired outcomes; the server resolves functional dependencies dynamically.

This project serves as both a **reference implementation** and a **foundation** for building systems using FAST concepts.
